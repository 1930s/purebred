Currently collecting ideas for a new terminal based e-mail client and
whether it is worth hacking on it.

## Ideas

* only based on notmuch or xapian

* undo tree of actions: in cases where tagging has gone wrong and the
  user wants to go back in history

* Lookup of mails while composing new mails. In mutt it was always a
  pain to either start a new instance to lookup important details of a
  mail you're replying to or postone the mail, lookup the detail and
  continue

## Open Questions

- License?
- Toolkit to use? (brick)[https://github.com/jtdaugherty/brick) is
  looking interesting
